This is the repository to hold the code for rIoT in MASS 2019. 

## Getting Started

This project is a IoT GUI simulator built to analyze the performance of the rIoT framework. To run the simulator, run main from src/SwingComponents/InitialPrompt.java. 

## Test and simulation.

In order to test various IoT frameworks and algorithms, we implemented several scenarios including two floor plans from the [CASAS dataset](http://casas.wsu.edu/datasets/). After the initial prompt, you can choose the floor plan to use. However, since we cannot distribute the actual dataset without the explict permission from CASAS group, the option "Play CASAS HH118" and "Simulate dataset HH107" does not work as expected.
